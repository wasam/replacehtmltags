# TODO? #

I'm quite sure, span2div can be improved - for example by adding

  * definitions/configuration (e.g. as array) for which types of elements to replace by other kinds
  * a check for certain e.g. classes within a class-attribute, indicating this tag to be replaced by a certain different kind of tag (e.g. class="... span2div\_replace\_me\_by\_div ...")
